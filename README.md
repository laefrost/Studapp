# A web-based Quiz-App with Peer-Instruction Features (Student)

This is the **students app** for use in teaching. The corresponding lecturer app can be found here: (https://github.com/RobertBetschinger/Dozentenapp). Please note that the App is implemented as a client/server architecture.

The combination of both apps enables you to implement an interactive form of teaching. The project is based on scientific methods and was developed for the use of a Digital Forensics Workshop. However, this app can be adapted for any kind of teaching content.
